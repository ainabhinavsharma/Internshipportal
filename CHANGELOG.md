# Changelog

All notable changes to the DBERT Internship Portal project are documented in this file.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed
- **Gemini API Key Configuration Contrast & Visibility**:
  - Fixed severe CSS leak where unscoped `body { color: var(--bg-inset); }` in [dbert-theme.css](file:///d:/Internshipportal/static/css/dbert-theme.css) turned body paragraphs, lists, and instructions near-white on light backgrounds across the application.
  - Properly scoped all `body`, `h2`, `ul`, `li`, `label`, `input`, and `button` rules in [dbert-theme.css](file:///d:/Internshipportal/static/css/dbert-theme.css) to their respective views (`pg-cv-pdf`, `pg-post-form`, and `pg-account-gemini-key`).
  - Restyled `.nudge-banner`, `.guide-box`, and `.link-get-key` with high-contrast text (`#78350F`, `#0F172A`, `#2563EB`) ensuring full WCAG compliance.
- **Gemini API Key Live Validation Error Feedback & Usability**:
  - Allowed both classic (`AIzaSy...`) and newer Google key formats (e.g. `AQ...`) by removing arbitrary prefix constraints and delegating verification directly to Google's Generative Language API.
  - Upgraded `_validate_gemini_key_live` in [app.py](file:///d:/Internshipportal/app.py) to sanitize input (stripping whitespace, quotes, and copy artifacts), increased timeout from 6s to 12s, and parsed Google Generative Language API responses to return precise, actionable feedback (distinguishing between wrong key formats, invalid API keys, disabled APIs, quota limits, and timeouts).
  - Added show/hide password visibility toggle in [account_gemini_key.html](file:///d:/Internshipportal/templates/account_gemini_key.html) to allow users to verify their pasted key before submission.
  - Replaced generic error text with styled alert containers (`.msg-error`, `.msg-success`, `.msg-loading`).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added
- **Restored Phone Number Input in Sign Up Form**:
  - Restored phone number input field in Step 1 of Sign Up modal with `+91` country prefix badge.
  - Fully harmonized styling with the dark charcoal & gold theme (`.phone-input-wrap`, `.phone-prefix`, focus states with golden border glow `#D49A37`).
  - Added dual identifier support in Sign In: users can authenticate via either their registered Email or 10-digit Phone Number (`check_email` and `intern_login`).
- **Provisioned Dedicated Test Accounts**:
  - **Admin Account**: `admin@dbert.online` (Staff account with full privileges).
  - **Test User Account**: `testuser@dbert.online` (Phone: `9998887776`, enrolled intern account).

### Fixed
- **Admin Logout Functionality**:
  - Resolved issue where logging out of `/admin` redirected back to `/admin` due to persistent Flask session cookie containing `admin_id`.
  - Updated `_clear_session_cookie()` in `app.py` to invoke `session.clear()`, completely flushing the Flask session.
  - Updated `admin_logout` endpoint to support both `GET` and `POST`, and updated `templates/admin.html` `doLogout()` to purge `sessionStorage` and `localStorage` before redirecting to `/admin-login`.
- **User Dashboard (`/portal`) Blank Screen and Network Error**:
  - **JS ReferenceError**: Declared missing `ALL_DOMAINS` and `DOMAIN_EMOJIS` constants in `templates/portal.html` that previously broke `populateApplyAnother()` and `renderOverview()`, halting dashboard initialization.
  - **CSS Specificity Override**: Fixed `dbert-theme.css` where high-specificity selector `body.portal .panel { display: none; }` overrode `.panel.active`, keeping active panels invisible. Added `body.portal .panel.active { display: block !important; }`.
- **Admin User Deletion & Cascade Purge**:
  - **Resolved 500 Crash on Bulk Delete**: Removed call to non-existent function `log_audit_event()` that crashed `/admin/users/bulk-delete` with a `NameError` and caused database rollbacks.
  - **Full Cascading Deletion**: Replaced incomplete soft-delete (`UPDATE is_active=0`) with full transactional cascade deletion across all associated user records: applications, enrollments, attendance, sessions, device profiles, tutor progress, password resets, interviews, tokens, certificates, and submissions.
  - **Response Payload Alignment**: Fixed JSON response to return `deleted: count` (instead of `deactivated`), enabling the UI toast to display accurate confirmation (`"Deleted 1 user."`).
- **Admin Users Tab Row Deduplication (Image 1 Fix)**:
  - Fixed Cartesian product bug in `admin_users()` in `app.py` where a raw `LEFT JOIN device_profiles dp ON dp.email = ia.email` caused users with multiple device profiles to duplicate across multiple rows (e.g., repeating the same user 4 times).
  - Aggregated device profiles via `LEFT JOIN (SELECT email, MAX(intent_score) AS intent_score FROM device_profiles WHERE email IS NOT NULL AND email != '' GROUP BY email) dp ON LOWER(dp.email) = LOWER(ia.email)`, guaranteeing exactly one unique row per registered user.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-12

### Changed & Overhauled
- **Footer Theme Harmonization (Image 1)**:
  - Transitioned the footer from mismatched dark navy block with empty margins to seamlessly integrate with the clean modern page theme: crisp white surface (`#FFFFFF`), subtle border-top (`1px solid #E2E8F0`), high-contrast dark headings (`#0F172A`), legible slate links (`#475569` with hover `#0F172A`), and clear social icons.

- **Auth Modal Redesign Matching Images 2 & 3**:
  - Restyled `#authOverlay` to match the exact dark obsidian & amber aesthetic shown in Images 2 and 3.
  - Charcoal card container (`#0E111A`) with subtle border (`rgba(255,255,255,0.08)`), pill toggle tabs (`#141724`) with golden/amber active tab (`#D49A37`, `#000000` text).
  - **Sign In Tab (Image 2)**: Centered uppercase `EMAIL` label, dark input field (`#141824`), and golden pill `-> Continue` CTA button.
  - **Sign Up Tab (Image 3)**: 3-step numbered progress indicators (golden circle 1 with `Account` label), `CREATE YOUR ACCOUNT` header, two-column form grid with uppercase labels, custom checkboxes with golden legal links, and golden `+ Create account & continue` CTA button.

- **Auth Modal Alignment & Layout Proportioning (Fix Cut-off / Width Mismatch)**:
  - Unified widths of `.auth-tabs` and `.auth-card` to match identically (`100%` of `.auth-wrapper` at `max-width: 470px`), resolving the mismatched pill tab overflow.
  - Compacted vertical padding and spacing across `.auth-card`, step indicators, field grids, and submit buttons.
  - Enabled smooth flex-centering with `margin: auto` inside `#authOverlay` to prevent bottom buttons and footer captions from clipping on standard laptop viewports.
- **Forgot Password Flow & Database Verification (Image 4)**:
  - Updated `/forgot-password` in `app.py` to query the database and explicitly verify whether the email exists.
  - Non-existent emails now return a clear error: `"No account found with this email in our database. Please check your email or Sign Up."`.
  - Registered emails generate a secure reset token, attempt email dispatch, log the reset URL in server logs, and in development mode provide a direct reset link so testing is never blocked.
  - Styled the forgot password modal to match Image 4 with high-contrast green success alerts.

- **Account Creation Email Existence Check**:
  - Integrated real-time blur check on the signup email field to notify users immediately if their email already exists in the database.
  - Updated form submission error handling to show an inline warning with an instant `"Sign in instead"` link rather than jarring tab shifts.

- **Text Contrast & Visibility Across Application**:
  - Upgraded global CSS text ramp variables: `--tx-body` (`#1E293B`) and `--tx-muted` (`#475569`).
  - Improved readability of section subtitles, domain cards, benefits cards, FAQ answers, badges, and form placeholders to ensure compliance with WCAG AA contrast standards.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-12

### Changed & Overhauled
- **Theme Overhaul to Match Image 2 Aesthetic Across Entire Application**:
  - Transitioned global palette from dark obsidian to the clean, modern light aesthetic shown in Image 2: Slate canvas (`#F8FAFC`), crisp white surface cards (`#FFFFFF`), deep navy headings/buttons (`#0F172A`), royal blue brand accent (`#2563EB`), and muted slate labels (`#64748B`).
  - Implemented 2-column hero with photorealistic student photography, floating interactive badges ("Build Learn Grow", "10K+ Students growing with DBERT"), and duration/mode pills.
  - Implemented 6-card "Browse by Domain" grid with soft pastel badges (AI, Data Analysis, Full Stack, Python Automation, Web Development, More Domains).
  - Implemented 2-column "Skip the wait with our Paid Program" banner with student photography, blue checkmark benefits, and primary CTA.
  - Implemented 4-card "Benefits & Perks" grid with pastel icons (Completion Certificate, LOR, Performance Stipend, Offer Letter).
  - Implemented 2-column FAQ accordion grid matching Image 2 layout.
  - Implemented dark navy modern footer (`#0B1220`) with MSME registration badge, links, social icons, and copyright.
  - Applied design tokens across all views (`portal.html`, `courses_catalog.html`, `tasks_list.html`, etc.) via global CSS root variables.

- **Scroll Performance & Lag Elimination**:
  - Eliminated virtual scroll-wheel interception and heavy ticker syncing that caused scroll lag on Windows platforms.
  - Restored native hardware-accelerated smooth scrolling (`scrollBehavior = 'smooth'`) with zero latency.
  - Wrapped interactive mousemove handlers in `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure 60/120fps fluid responsiveness.

- **Redesigned Auth Modal (Login / Sign Up)**:
  - Rebuilt `#authOverlay` with high-contrast centered card, frosted backdrop `rgba(15,23,42,0.7)`, pure white card `#FFFFFF`, rounded corners `24px`, and dark navy pill CTA button `#0F172A`.
  - Fixed field alignment, step transitions, and scrolling so that Step 1 (Account), Step 2 (Academics), Step 3 (Profile & Goals), and Sign In render cleanly without clipping or overflow issues.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added
- **Modern Creative UI & Animation Stack**:
  - Integrated **Lenis** (`lenis.min.js`) for smooth, hardware-accelerated inertia scrolling.
  - Integrated **GSAP** & **ScrollTrigger** (`gsap.min.js`, `ScrollTrigger.min.js`) for staggered hero entrance animations and viewport reveal effects.
  - Added **React-Bits** inspired interactive UI components: spotlight cards (`.spotlight-card` with dynamic cursor tracking), magnetic action buttons (`.btn-magnetic`), and organic ambient aurora mesh (`.aurora-bg`).
  - Added modern design tokens in `dbert-theme.css` with cosmic obsidian canvas (`#07080E`), luminous glass panels (`#0E111D`), celestial amber accent (`#F59E0B`), and electric indigo/cyan accents.
- **Automated Verification Suite**:
  - Playwright test script validating Lenis, GSAP, CSS performance rules, authentication modal toggling, domain routing, and portal auth guarding.

### Fixed
- **Performance / Lag Elimination**:
  - Replaced CPU/GPU-taxing 90px CSS Gaussian blurs on large Aurora background elements with performant multi-stop CSS radial gradients, hardware compositing (`will-change: transform`, `transform: translate3d(0,0,0)`), and `contain: paint`.
  - Added `requestAnimationFrame` debouncing on cursor tracking events (`mousemove`) in `creative-ui.js` to prevent continuous DOM reflows and layout recalculations.
  - Tuned Lenis scroll duration to `0.65s` for instantaneous, crisp scroll responsiveness.
- **Auth Modal Visibility (Image 1)**:
  - Fixed CSS selector specificity conflict in `dbert-theme.css` where `body.home .auth-panel` (specificity `0,2,1`) had hidden the form inputs inside the `.active` panel.
  - Added `body.home .auth-panel.active { display: block !important; }` so that Sign In and 3-step Sign Up forms render completely with all form inputs.
- **Domain Cards 404 Error (Image 2)**:
  - Resolved issue in `app.py` where `/jobs/<slug>` and `/internships/<slug>` only matched city locations and returned 404 for domain slugs.
  - Added domain slug check against `DOMAIN_SLUGS` to redirect domain URLs cleanly to filtered search listings (`/jobs?domain=...`).
- **Portal Endless Spinner / Profile Error (Image 3)**:
  - Fixed issue where unauthenticated visitors navigating directly to `/portal` hit 401 on `/intern/me`, showing an error toast and stalling indefinitely on "Loading your portal...".
  - Added server-side session check in `portal_page()` in `app.py` and client-side 401 handler in `portal.html` to redirect unauthenticated visitors cleanly to `/#signin`.
